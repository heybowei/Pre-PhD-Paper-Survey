# Pre-PhD-Paper-Survey
This repo is meant to remind myself the progress of my paper survey in advance. I hope that I can read more papers, get idea inspirations, and improve writing skills.

## Keep in Mind That

### Do Not accept everything in the paper

Critical thinking is the key to find new way to improve and challenge myself.

### Try to use STAR Principle

Situation, task, action, result.

### Always open to new techniques

New techniques from even other area can help a lot. New techniques always help somehow.

### Conclude and Be Egoism

Try to conclude papers and remember that reading papers is for yourself: find anything that can benefit and even be used for your research.
